Hey, I'm Lisa!

I spent my formative years in the bustling city of Shanghai where I discovered my interest for problem-solving when I was selected into the Olympiad math class at a local middle school.

Later, I had the opportunity to embark on a new adventure by moving to Vancouver for high school, and then University of Waterloo to pursue my interest in Data Science. 

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Amazon, while pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech part time. 

This website serves as a platform to share my journey and insights with the community. Whether it's discussing emerging technologies, exploring data-driven solutions, or simply exchanging ideas, I am excited to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
