Hey, I'm Lisa!

I spent my formative years in the bustling city of Shanghai where I discovered my interest for problem-solving when I joined the olympiad math class at a local middle school.

Later, I had the opportunity to embark on a new adventure by attending University of Waterloo to pursue my interest in Data Science and finished 5 co-ops working in different industries. 

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Amazon in New York City, while completing my Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech part time. 

During spare time, I enjoy [photography](https://koileee.github.io/photography/), bouldering, playing Go and watching anime.

This website serves as a platform to share my interests and journey in the technology community. 

Whether it's discussing emerging technologies, exploring data-driven solutions, or simply exchanging ideas, I am excited to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
