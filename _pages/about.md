Hey, I'm Lisa!

I spent my formative years in the bustling city of Shanghai where I discovered my interest for problem-solving when I was selected into the olympiad math class at a local middle school.

Later, I had the opportunity to embark on a new adventure by moving to Vancouver for secondary school, and then University of Waterloo to pursue my interest in Data Science. 

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Amazon in New York City, while finishing my Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech part time. 

This website serves as a platform to share my journey and insights with the community. Whether it's discussing emerging technologies, exploring data-driven solutions, or simply exchanging ideas, I am excited to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
